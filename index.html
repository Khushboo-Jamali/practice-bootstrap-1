        The definition of technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical
         purposes or applications. Technology uses scientific principles, and applies them to 
         change the environment in which humans live. Technology can also use scientific principles 
         to advance industry or other human constructions.
         The word technology comes from two Greek words, transliterated techne and logos. Techne 
         means art, skill, craft, or the way, manner, or means by which a thing is gained. Logos 
         means word, the utterance by which inward thought is expressed, a saying, or an expression.</p>

        In ancient times, technology was defined by Homer and Hesiod as the spoken word of manual 
        craft or cunning skill (Luna, 1994). By 330 BC, Aristotle coined the Greek term technologia 
        and split scientific knowledge into three parts: theoretical science, practical science, and productive science (technology).
        Thomas Edison, American inventor who, singly or jointly, held a world-record 1,093 patents. 
        In addition, he created the world's first industrial research laboratory. Thomas Edison created 
        the world's first industrial research laboratory and is known as the father of technology.D

        maintenance, and use of computer systems and networks; but it encompasses 
        a wide variety of tech-based disciplines that deal with information and data.
